The "mydata" subfolder contains basic ecological information on fish species and references.

The other subfolders ("pars_init" and "predict") help determine DEB parameters for each species from the "mydata" files.

The AmP-Species-Information only acts as a repository to ease the access to the information used in Di Stefano et al, 2024 (Early-life dispersal traits of coastal fishes: a long-term database combining observations and growth models) published in ESSD as a preprint for the moment (https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-2024-22).

All files belong to and come from the AddmyPet database (https://www.bio.vu.nl/thb/deb/deblab/add_my_pet/). They have been downloaded before 11 July 2022 and copied in this repository. These files do not belong to the author of the AmP-Species-Information repository.
